## Abstract
The University of Regina Facilities Management department is in the process of updating its dashboard for a new energy consumption management system. 
One feature to incorporate is relating energy consumption with the occupancy in specific areas. 
Our project provides temperature measurement, noise and CO2 levels in a particular space and determines the occupancy in that area. 
ROMS is a portable and easily relocatable enclosure with three sensor modules that output data to a microcontroller. 
The microcontroller will send the data to a proprietary data hub. 
The proprietary data hub will be saving and sending the data in a file format to the university dashboard. 
The Room Occupancy Management System device is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows the individual to set the system according to the room size. 
To relate to occupancy we werenâ€™t able to get enough raw data because of testing constraints due to covid-19 regulations.
In real time operation with crowded areas we could get actual readings.
