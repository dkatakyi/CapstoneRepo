This is our university of regina capstone project.

##ROMS – Room Occupancy Management System

Abstract:
The University of Regina Facilities Management department is in the process of updating its dashboard for a new energy consumption management system. 
One feature to incorporate is relating energy consumption with the occupancy in specific areas. 
Our project provides temperature measurement, noise and CO2 levels in a particular space and determines the occupancy in that area. 
ROMS is a portable and easily relocatable enclosure with three sensor modules that output data to a microcontroller. 
The microcontroller will send the data to a proprietary data hub. 
The proprietary data hub will be saving and sending the data in a file format to the university dashboard. 
The Room Occupancy Management System device is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows the individual to set the system according to the room size. 
To relate to occupancy we weren’t able to get enough raw data because of testing constraints due to covid-19 regulations.
In real time operation with crowded areas we could get actual readings.
